1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,380
Part 4. You will hear a professor of philosophy giving a talk on the ancient philosophy of Stoicism.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,460
First, you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,320
Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40.

4
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:19,030
Ancient philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing or even reading long, dense books.

5
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:29,130
In fact, it is something people have used throughout history to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs.

6
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:40,410
Specifically, I am referring to Stoicism, which in my opinion is the most practical of all philosophies and therefore the most appealing.

7
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:48,350
Stoicism was founded in ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC,

8
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:55,410
but was practiced by the likes of Epictetus, Cato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.

9
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,670
Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas,

10
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:05,050
despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication.

11
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,570
Cato definitely didn't.

12
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,070
Marcus Aurelius never intended his meditations to be anything but personal.

13
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:22,630
Seneca's letters were, well, letters, and Epictetus's thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.

14
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:31,470
Stoic principles were based on the idea that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life,

15
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,570
and the key to achieving this was virtue.

16
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:41,490
The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions,

17
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,650
like anger and jealousy, are under our conscious control.

18
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,230
They don't have to control us, because we can learn to control them.

19
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,850
In the words of Epictetus,

20
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,670
external events I cannot control,

21
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,130
but the choices I make with regard to them I do control.

22
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,970
The modern-day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb

23
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,170
defines a Stoic as someone who has

24
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,610
a different perspective on experiences

25
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,090
which most of us would see as wholly negative.

26
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,810
A Stoic transforms fear into caution,

27
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,110
pain into transformation,

28
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,450
mistakes into initiation,

29
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,690
and desire into undertaking.

30
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,010
Using this definition as a model,

31
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,790
we can see that throughout the centuries,

32
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,790
Stoicism has been practised in more recent history

33
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,990
by kings, presidents,

34
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,070
artists, writers,

35
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,490
and entrepreneurs.

36
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,130
The founding fathers of the United States

37
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,850
were inspired by the philosophy.

38
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,210
George Washington was introduced to Stoicism

39
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,670
by his neighbours at age 17,

40
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,750
and later put on a play based on the life of Cato

41
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,410
to inspire his men.

42
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,090
Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.

43
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,670
Writers and artists have also been inspired by the Stoics.

44
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,810
Eugene Delacroix,

45
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,190
the renowned French Romantic artist,

46
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,950
known best for his painting

47
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,730
Liberty Leading the People,

48
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,970
was an ardent Stoic,

49
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,550
referring to it as his consoling religion.

50
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,590
The economist Adam Smith's theories on capitalism

51
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,830
were significantly influenced

52
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,030
by the Stoicism that he studied as a schoolboy

53
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,510
under a teacher who had translated

54
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,270
Marcus Aurelius's works.

55
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,730
Today's political leaders are no different,

56
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,070
with many finding their inspiration

57
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,010
from the ancient texts.

58
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,950
Former US President Bill Clinton

59
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,230
re-reads Marcus Aurelius

60
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,610
every single year,

61
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,430
and many have compared

62
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,730
former President Obama's calm leadership style

63
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,070
to that of Cato.

64
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,510
Wen Jiabao,

65
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,750
the former Prime Minister of China,

66
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,470
claims that meditations

67
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,890
is one of two books

68
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,110
he travels with,

69
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,690
and that he has read it

70
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,510
more than 100 times

71
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,210
over the course of his life.

72
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,710
Stoicism had a profound influence

73
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,010
on Albert Ellis,

74
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,990
who invented

75
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,710
cognitive behaviour therapy,

76
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,430
which is used to help people

77
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,490
manage their problems

78
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,110
by changing the way

79
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,930
that they think and behave.

80
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,270
It's most commonly used

81
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,570
to treat depression.

82
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,830
The idea is that

83
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,790
we can take control of our lives

84
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,770
by challenging the irrational beliefs

85
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,690
that create our faulty thinking,

86
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,590
symptoms,

87
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,010
and behaviours

88
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,290
by using logic instead.

89
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,110
Stoicism

90
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,250
has also become popular

91
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,530
in the world of business.

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,110
Stoic principles

93
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,430
can build the resilience

94
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,610
and state of mind

95
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,650
required to overcome setbacks,

96
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,070
because Stoics

97
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,990
teach turning obstacles

98
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,150
into opportunity.

99
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,630
A lesson

100
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,410
every business entrepreneur

101
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,450
needs to learn.

102
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,870
I would argue that

103
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,450
studying Stoicism

104
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,110
is as relevant today

105
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,870
as it was

106
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,570
2,000 years ago,

107
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,070
thanks to its brilliant insights

108
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,590
into how to lead a good life.

109
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,470
At the very root

110
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,330
of the thinking,

111
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,930
there is a very simple

112
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,730
way of living.

113
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,030
Control what you can

114
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,270
and accept

115
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,630
what you can't.

116
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,770
This is not as easy

117
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,510
as it sounds

118
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,810
and will require

119
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,410
considerable practice.

120
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,490
It can take a lifetime

121
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,290
to master.

122
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,950
The Stoics

123
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,210
also believed

124
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,390
the most important

125
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,070
foundation

126
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,110
for a good

127
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,170
and happy life

128
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,510
is not money,

129
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,070
fame,

130
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:52,970
power,

131
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:53,770
or pleasure,

132
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,290
but having

133
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,150
a disciplined

134
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,570
and principled

135
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,230
character.

136
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,090
Something which

137
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,990
seems to resonate

138
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,450
with many people

139
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:02,830
today.

140
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,790
You now have

141
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,410
one minute

142
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,030
to check

143
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,650
your answers

144
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,590
to part 4.

145
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,690
That is the end

146
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,690
of the listening test.

147
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,490
In the IELTS test,

148
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,490
you would now

149
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,510
have 10 minutes

150
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,430
to transfer

151
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,150
your answers

152
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,210
to the answer sheet.

153
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:20,250
and if you

154
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,270
have a good

155
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,310
complete

156
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,410
approach

157
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:20,750
because I might
